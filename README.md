# A Neural Network from scratch and application with the MNIST datasets.
This project is to build a neural network from scratch and implementing it on the popular MNIST dataset. <br>
It is based on the book _Make Your Own Neural Network_ by _Tariq Rashid_.
<br>

These are the main resource I used:
- _Make Your Own Neural Network_ by _Tariq Rashid_. [The book repository.](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork)
- [The MNIST Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)
### Directory
- datasets: contain the MNIST datasets (train and test)
- mnist.py: main python file
- Python library: [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) and [Scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/) (optional)

### Result and Improvement
Currently, test accuracy is around 75%. <br>Later improvement may involve :
- tinkering of the learning rate
- modification of the train and test sample
- implementation of cross-validation
